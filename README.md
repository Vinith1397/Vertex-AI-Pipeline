# Vertex-AI-Pipeline
Developed an automated machine learning (ML) pipeline using Vertex AI and Kubeflow Pipelines SDK to streamline the process of model training, evaluation, and deployment. The project involved creating custom components for processing data and integrating pre-built components for leveraging Vertex AI's ML services

Please go through the steps to set the required environment and create the pipelines

# Vertex AI Pipeline Project

## Description

This project demonstrates the creation and execution of a machine learning pipeline using Google Cloud's Vertex AI and Kubeflow Pipelines SDK. It includes steps for setting up Vertex Notebooks, installing necessary libraries, and building an end-to-end ML pipeline that covers data preprocessing, model training with AutoML, and conditional model deployment based on evaluation metrics.

## Technologies Used

- Vertex AI
- Kubeflow Pipelines SDK
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook

## Setup and Installation

Ensure you have a Google Cloud Platform account. Follow the steps in `setup.ipynb` to create a Vertex AI Notebooks instance and install all required libraries.

## How to Use

1. Open `pipeline.ipynb` in Vertex AI Notebooks.
2. Follow the notebook steps to compile and run the ML pipeline.
3. Monitor the pipeline execution in Vertex AI's console.

For more details, refer to the individual steps and code within the `code/` directory.
