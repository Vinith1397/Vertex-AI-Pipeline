# Vertex-AI-Pipeline
## Description

This project demonstrates the creation and execution of a machine learning pipeline using Google Cloud's Vertex AI and Kubeflow Pipelines SDK. It includes steps for setting up Vertex Notebooks, installing necessary libraries, and building an end-to-end ML pipeline that covers data preprocessing, model training with AutoML, and conditional model deployment based on evaluation metrics.

## Technologies Used

- Vertex AI
- Kubeflow Pipelines SDK
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook

## Setup and Installation

Ensure you have a Google Cloud Platform account. Follow the steps in `setup.ipynb` to create a Vertex AI Notebooks instance and install all required libraries.

## How to Use

1. Open `setup.ipynb``pipeline.ipynb``endtoendpipeline.ipynb``metrics.ipynb` in Vertex AI Notebooks.
2. Follow the notebook steps to compile and run the ML pipeline.Please go through the steps to set the required environment and create the pipelines
3. Monitor the pipeline execution in Vertex AI's console.
